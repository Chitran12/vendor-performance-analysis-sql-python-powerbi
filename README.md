### Overview
This project evaluates vendor performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization. A complete data pipeline was built using SQL for ETL, Python for analysis and hypothesis testing, and Power BI for visualization.

### Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical in the retail sector. This project aims to:

* Identify underperforming brands needing pricing or promotional adjustments
* Determine vendor contributions to sales and profits
* Analyze the cost-benefit of bulk purchasing
* Investigate inventory turnover inefficiencies
* Statistically validate differences in vendor profitability

### Dataset

* Multiple CSV files located in data folder (sales, vendors, inventory)
* Summary table created from ingested data and used for analysis

### Tools & Technologies

* SQL (Common Table Expressions, Joins, Filtering)
* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
* Power BI (Interactive Visualizations)
* GitHub


### Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Removed transactions with:
   * Gross Profit ≤ 0
   * Profit Margin ≤ 0
   * Sales Quantity = 0
* Created summary tables with vendor-level metrics
* Converted data types, handled outliers, merged lookup tables

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Negative or Zero Values Detected:**

* Gross Profit: Min -52,002.78 (loss-making sales)
* Profit Margin: Min -∞ (sales at zero or below cost)
* Unsold Inventory: Indicating slow-moving stock

**Outliers Identified:**
 
* High Freight Costs (up to 257K)
* Large Purchase/Actual Prices

**Correlation Analysis:**

* Weak between Purchase Price & Profit
* Strong between Purchase Qty & Sales Qty (0.999)
* Negative between Profit Margin & Sales Price (-0.179)

### Research Questions & Key Findings

1. Brands for Promotions: 198 brands with low sales but high profit margins
2. Top Vendors: Top 10 vendors = 65.69% of purchases → risk of over-reliance
3. Bulk Purchasing Impact: 72% cost savings per unit in large orders
4. Inventory Turnover: $2.71M worth of unsold inventory
5. Vendor Profitability:
*  High Vendors: Mean Margin = 31.17%
*  Low Vendors: Mean Margin = 41.55%
6. Hypothesis Testing: Statistically significant difference in profit margins → distinct vendor strategies


### Dashboard

**Power BI Dashboard shows:**
* Vendor-wise Sales and Margins
* Inventory Turnover
* Bulk Purchase Savings
* Performance Heatmaps

### How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository:

*git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vendor-performance-analysis.git*

3. Load the CSVs and ingest into database:
*python scripts/ingestion_db.py*

4. Create vendor summary table:
*python scripts/get_vendor_summary.py*

5. Open and run notebooks:
* notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
* notebooks/vendor_performance_analysis.ipynb

5. Open Power BI Dashboard:
* dashboard/vendor_performance_dashboard.pbix   

### Final Recommendations

* Diversify vendor base to reduce risk
* Optimize bulk order strategies
* Reprice slow-moving, high-margin brands
* Clear unsold inventory strategically
* Improve marketing for underperforming vendors
